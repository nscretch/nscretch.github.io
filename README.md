## Issues
- There may be issues accessing the HTTPS URL for this site with both the Apex domain (e.g. `example.com`) and www subdomain (e.g. `www.example.com`). Based on following conversation, may need to toggle GitHub Pages custom domain entry to refresh certs or set up redirection from Apex to www in domain configuration: <https://github.community/t/does-github-pages-support-https-for-www-and-subdomains/10360>
